# DiscordGIFBot

This is a simple discord bot which you can use for generating gifs.

## Description

This discord bot was implemented using node/js and tenor api. You only need to mention the bot and type command with what type of gif you need. Using the tenor api the 
bot will generate appropiate results and save some of them to an arraylist and then it will return a random gif(element) from that arraylist.

## Requirements

You will need some of the discord pacakages.
All the packages I used are in the package.json file
You can read more info about those from here https://discordjs.guide/miscellaneous/useful-packages.html#day-js 
And a tenor account which you connect your bot to get gifs. You can use any other platform also, like giphy.

-- main code is in the bot.js file
